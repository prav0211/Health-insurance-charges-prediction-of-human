Introduction
In today's world, health insurance has become an essential part of financial planning due to the unpredictability of health issues. With diseases like COVID-19, dengue, heart attacks, and many other health risks, no one can be certain about the future. It is crucial to ensure that the primary breadwinner of a family is financially secure in case of unforeseen health challenges.

This project analyzes health insurance data to predict the insurance charges an individual might pay, based on various factors in their daily life. By leveraging different regression techniques, we aim to predict these charges and compare the effectiveness of these models.

Additionally, we provide insights into the lifestyle factors that can influence insurance charges, helping individuals make better choices to manage their health and costs.

Project Statement
The primary goal of this project is to analyze health insurance data and predict the amount an individual might have to pay for their insurance based on several lifestyle factors.

The project will involve the following steps:

Dataset Collection: Download and prepare the dataset.
Data Analysis: Analyze the dataset using different graphs and techniques to understand the relationships between features.
Model Implementation: Apply various regression techniques to predict the health insurance charges.
Model Comparison: Evaluate and compare the performance of the models used.

We utilized the dataset to build an analysis model and applied both Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Polynomial Linear Regression (PLR) to predict the charges. These models were then compared to assess which performed better.

Project Output
Upon analyzing the results through graphs and evaluating the performance using RÂ² scores, we observed the following key findings:

PLR outperforms MLR for this particular dataset.
PLR with degree 3 yielded the best performance, followed by degrees 2, 4, and 1 (MLR).
We achieved 88% accuracy in predicting the health insurance charges.
